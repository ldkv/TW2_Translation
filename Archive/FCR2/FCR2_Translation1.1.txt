90812		Geralt headed beneath the ground and started looking for the cause of the problem. He quickly discovered that the miners had delved too deep and had broken through to ancient tunnels carved by creatures never meant to see the light of day. The creatures were entering the mines through fissures in the rock, and Geralt decided to collapse these breaches using bombs known as grapeshots.

102753		[[Marten]]Symbolizing spring and rejuvenation, the swallow lent its name to this potion that accelerates the rate at which wounds scab over and heal. As a universal brew, it is good on many occasions and additionally produces no side effects.&lt;br&gt;The witcher can use the Swallow potion to balance out some of the undesirable effects of potions like Thunderbolt, Maribor Forest, Lapwing, Tiara and Stammelford's Philter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion increases Toxicity moderately when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;It is recommended before long fights. Slow but consistent Vitality regeneration will provide a significant advantage over foes. Witchers unsure of the dangers they might face in a given situation consume this universal brew as a failsafe.
98966		[[White Raffards Decoction]]Invented by a famous mage, this potion helps the witcher survive wounds that would normally be lethal to him. The buzz from this powerful brew, however, adversely affects coordination. After consuming it, although he is fortified, the witcher deals reduced damage for a short time. This side effect can be alleviated by drinking the Rook potion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This potion significantly increases Toxicity when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;It should be consumed before fights that could prove particularly difficult.
98976		[[Concretion]]Wolf helps the witcher focus. It increases the effectiveness of strikes designed to cause one single devastating attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion increases Toxicity moderately when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;Wolf is recommended in situations where the witcher is expecting a long fight. A single successful precision strike could end the fight in an instant.
98982		[[Kiss]]Kiss increases resistance to special attacks that cause Bleeding, while producing no side effects of its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion increases Toxicity moderately when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;Kiss is recommended before fighting monsters that employ powerful lacerating attacks.
98980		[[Golden Oriole]]Created by Herbert Stammelford, a famous member of the first Conclave, this brew is readily used by witchers who rely on magic, since it augments the intensity of Signs – the damage done by the Igni, the impact of the Aard, the defenses of the Quen, and so on.&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, the potion taps the witcher's Vitality for its power, thus reducing it. Witchers compensate for this loss by consuming the Swallow potion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion very significantly increases Toxicity when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;It is recommended for witchers who rely more heavily on magic than on traditional weapons, and before any fight against monsters vulnerable to the special attacks issuing from Signs.
98988		[[Maribor Forest]]Golden Oriole, one of the best-known witcher potions, increases resistance to special attacks that cause Poisoning, while producing no side effects of its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion increases Toxicity moderately when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;Golden Oriole is recommended before fighting disease carrying monsters. It is especially effective against venomous creatures.

It is especially effective against venomous creatures.
101991		Potion. Increases resistance to Poisoning.

98973		Shrike
98974		[[Shrike]]This singular potion carries molecules that combined with witcher's metabolites create a toxic by-product. Each time the witcher's blood comes in contact with air it turns into a poisonous substance. This poison is easily absorbed by skin, so those individuals lucky enough to injure the witcher in combat, quickly regret it.&lt;br&gt;Potion causes serious intoxication when imbibed.
98265		Formula: Shrike
98020		Shrike
102225		Potion. Attackers have a chance to be Poisoned.

98970		[[Wolf]]Maribor Forest considerably boosts Vigor. After consuming it, the witcher tirelessly parries blows and can cast many Signs in a row.&lt;br&gt;It is, however, a devastating brew that reduces Vitality. Its side effects can be somehow alleviated by consuming the Swallow or Gadwall potions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Potion causes serious intoxication when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;This potion is used by witchers who specialize in casting Signs and by those preparing to fight monsters with strong attacks that must be parried.
102293		Potion. Significantly increases Vigor while reducing Vitality.

98971		Wolverine
98972		[[Wolverine]]Wolverine is especially popular among witchers who believe that killing monsters quickly is their best defense. This potion increases muscle power, and thus damage dealt to foes in close combat. Unlike Thunderbolt, it has no side effects.&lt;br&gt;Wolverine can alleviate the side effects of Petri's Philter and Gadwall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Potion causes minor intoxication when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;The potion is recommended for witchers who prefer to use their swords in fights and employ Signs sporadically. Rook is especially helpful against resilient and heavily armored opponents.
98257		Formula: Wolverine
102292		Potion. Increases damage dealt with swords.
98024		Wolverine

98990		[[Petri Philter]]This potion, created by a student of a famous mage of the first Conclave, is weaker than Stammelford's Philter, but still causes muscle numbness that decrease damage dealt with the sword. Petri's Philter increases the intensity of witcher Signs – the impact of the Aard, the defenses of the Quen, the effectiveness of the Yrden, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potion increases Toxicity very markedly when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;It is recommended for witchers who rely more heavily on magic than on their swords, and before fights against monsters vulnerable to Signs.
102031		Potion. Increases Sign intensity at the expense of damage dealt.

98029		Wolf
98975		Wolf

A single successful precision strike could end the fight in an instant.
98268		Formula: Wolf
101392		Potion. Increases chance of instant kill attack.

98964		[[Thunderbolt]]The Thunderbolt potion augments muscle power and concenration and thus damage dealt using a sword. As simple as it is effective, the brew is a more powerful version of the Wolverine potion.&lt;br&gt;Such close concentration, however, weakens the witcher's defenses. Intent on dealing damage to his foes, the user becomes susceptible to their attacks as his chance to parry decreases. This loss can be counterbalanced by the Blizzard potion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Potion significantly increases Toxicity when imbibed.&lt;br&gt;This potion is recommended before fighting particularly resilient or heavily armored monsters.
102275		Potion. Significantly increases damage dealt while decreasing chance to parry attacks.
